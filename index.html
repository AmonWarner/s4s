            <span class="card-author"><b>By [DEV]RunningInTheBrush</b></span>
            <p>
              Hello everyone. For our alpha update we are doing some planning to
              the public:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>We'll be completely redesigning the site.</b> We will be
              changing the site to be simpler, and easier to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>We'll be removing premium.</b> Premium was an idea that never
              worked, meaning all games will now be free. We might bring it back
              another time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>We'll be focusing more on the site.</b> We used to only work on
              the chat, but now we will be focusing work on all parts of the
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Updates will be less often.</b> I am working on other projects,
              and this site's development will be slow. However, I will still
              have time to work here!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>See you all in the chat!</b>
